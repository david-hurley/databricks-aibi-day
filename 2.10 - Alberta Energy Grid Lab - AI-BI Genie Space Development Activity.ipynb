    "## 2.10 - Alberta Energy Grid Lab - AI/BI Genie Space Development Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "AI/BI Genie allows business users to conduct self-serve data analytics using natural language and without coding. After a Genie space is set up by a domain expert such as a data analyst, business users can ask their own questions and generate visualizations to help them understand the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will create and configure a Genie space, experiment with it as if you were an end user and generate feedback, and then return to the administrator's perspective and use that feedback to enhance the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses the following resources:\n",
    "- Tables:\n",
    "  - Catalog: dbacademy\n",
    "  - Schema: {dynamically named, personal to you}\n",
    "  - Tables:\n",
    "    - aeso_january_2024_demand\n",
    "    - aeso_january_2024_supply\n",
    "    - calgary_january_2024_temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "These tables contain real data representing electricity supply and demand and air temperature for the month of January 2024 in Alberta. Between January 11-14 2024, Alberta experienced a perfect storm of low renewable generation (i.e. wind and solar), extreme cold temperatures, and gas plant outages. This led the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) to issue an Energy Emergency Alert Level 3 - highest level of alert - and advise that rolling power outages would be required if demand was not decreased. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "The **aeso_january_2024_demand** and **aeso_january_2024_supply** tables contain hourly electricity demand and supply data, respectively, in MWs. The **calgary_january_2024_temperature** contains hourly air temperatures, in Celsius, as measured at the Calgary International Airport. These three tables are related via datetime. All datetimes are in MST. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the data in these tables to prepare your Genie space and ask questions in natural language over the data to understand the root causes.\n"

    "  * **SQL Queries** (the icon will look like a command prompt): Allows you to add example SQL queries for Genie to learn from specific to the associated dataset(s).\n",
    "* **Monitoring** (the icon that looks like a eye): Allows you to review what questions were asked, who asked them, and how they were rated by the user. \n",
    "* **Share** (the icon that looks like a lock): Allows you to set the share permissions and share the Genie space with end users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the kebab menu, you'll find:\n",
    "* **Benchmarks** (the icon that looks like a graduate's mortarboard): Allows you to define a suite of questions that you run on a recurring basis to ensure the space continues to give good answers to the most important user questions.\n",

    "1. Notice that our sample question about total peak demand is in a clickable button in the screen's main panel, and so is a sample question we didn't put in: \"Explain the data set\". Click on the **Explain the data set** button. Let's see how well Genie does in understanding our data with very little coaching.\n",
    "1. How did Genie do? Did it figure out that the data sets are linked via datetime? Click on the **`(âœ“)Yes`** icon below its response if it did, and click on **`(x)Fix it`** if it didn't.\n",
    "1. Now let's try the other sample question. Type in ```What was the peak total demand?``` and click the paper-airplane icon to submit it.\n",
    "1. Genie gives us a numerical answer. Do we trust it? Ask ```Plot a timeseries of all demand in January``` to compel Genie to visually show all demand.\n",
    "1. Does the max demand in the plot match the peak demand that Genie provided? Try hovering over the chart to confirm. Note, the visual might truncate some values. If it's close (including truncation) then click **`(âœ“)Yes`**; if not, click **`(x)Fix it`**.\n",
    "1. Let's continue exploring electricity supply and demand. Say ```What fuel type provides the most power across Alberta?```\n",
    "1. How did Genie do? Does this answer match what we saw in our dashboard in lab 1.10? If so click click **`(âœ“)Yes`**; if not, click **`(x)Fix it`**.\n",
    "1. We all know that LLMs can \"make stuff up\", so let's test Genie. Does Genie know that Bike Power is not a fuel type? Ask ```How much power is generated by fuel type Bike Power?``` Was its answer appropriate? Did it provide `Null`? If yes, give it a **`(âœ“)Yes`**, and a **`(x)Fix it`** if not.\n",
    "1. It's time for a more complex question. Say ```Plot the supply generated from wind for all of January```. Did it do well? Did it aggregate to a more useful time window such as daily? If not, try to give feedback. Ask it again but for a daily sum. \n",
    "1. Now we are getting somewhere - can you see what happened during the period January 12 to 14 (i.e. the supply shortage)? Does this help explain the shortage?\n",
    "1. Try asking further questions to understand more about the root causes of the supply shortage. Were there any extreme weather events that elevated demand?\n",
    "1. We can give Genie specific instructions, for example, provide a instruction for the last command, it may have been similar to ```Plot the supply generated from wind for all of January```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scroll back up and click on **Add as instruction** so as to save this query as an example query. You can give it a useful name and even provide user guidance that Genie will use to determine when to use this query. (Recall that you can only do this because you have at least edit rights on the Genie space. Your end users with only view rights can't add instructions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. If Genie gave you a line chart with that response, say \"give me a bar chart of that\" (and if it gave you a bar chart, ask instead for a line chart).\n",
    "1. Finally, let's ask Genie a question that has nothing to do with our company's data. Compose your own: try a trivia question about your favorite sports team, TV show, or musician. How does Genie respond?\n"
