    "\n",
    "AI/BI Genie allows business users to conduct self-serve data analytics using natural language and without coding. After a Genie space is set up by a domain expert such as a data analyst, business users can ask their own questions and generate visualizations to help them understand the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will create and configure a Genie space, experiment with it as if you were an end user and generate feedback, and then return to the administrator's perspective and use that feedback to enhance the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses the following resources:\n",
    "- Tables:\n",
    "  - Catalog: dbacademy\n",
    "  - Schema: {dynamically named, personal to you}\n",
    "  - Tables:\n",
    "    - aeso_january_2024_demand\n",
    "    - aeso_january_2024_supply\n",
    "    - calgary_january_2024_temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "These tables contain real data representing electricity supply and demand and air temperature for the month of January 2024 in Alberta. Between January 11-14 2024, Alberta experienced a perfect storm of low renewable generation (i.e. wind and solar), extreme cold temperatures, and gas plant outages. This led the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) to issue a \"state of emergency\" and that rolling outages would be required if demand was not decreased in order to keep critical infrastructure online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "You'll use the data in these tables to prepare your Genie space and ask questions in natural language over the data\n"

    "In this part of the lab, we'll start with creating a Genie space directly from the main Databricks user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ“Œ NOTE:** Many of the following instructions take place in a non-notebook area of the platform. It is recommended to open either the notebooks in a separate tab or window to reference the instructions alongside the area where they are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to **Genie** in the left-side navigation of the platform. (It is recommended to right-click and select Open Link in New Window or Tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **+ New** in the upper right corner.\n",
    "1. You'll be presented with the **Connect your data** dialogue box. Click **All** and navigate to dbacademy.YOURSCHEMA and select the following four tables: \n",
    "    - aeso_january_2024_demand\n",

    "\n",
    "In the resulting window, you'll be presented with a chat panel on the left and the configuration settings open on the right with **Context** and **Data** selected.\n",
    "1. Switch the view from **Context** to **Settings** and fill in the following details about the Genie space:\n",
    "    - Title: **Alberta Energy Grid Analysis**\n",
    "    - Description:\n",
    "      This Genie space allows business users to research historical electricity supply and demand in Alberta\n",
    "    - Default warehouse: shared_warehouse\n",
    "    - Sample Questions: Enter **What was the peak total demand?** and click **+ Add**\n",
    "1. Click **Save**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genie space's screen area is split into two sides with the chat window on the left and the configuration and settings on the right. The buttons at the top right allow you to choose among these areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **+ New chat**: Allows you to create a new threaded dialogues with Genie. After you publish a Genie space to end users (who will probably have only \"Can View\" or \"Can Run\" access), this is one of the only Genie areas they will have access to.\n",
    "* **History** (the icon that looks like a clock): Allows you to review the separate chat threads that you've had with Genie. After you publish a Genie space to end users (who will probably have only \"Can View\" or \"Can Run\" access), this is the other Genie area they will have access to.\n",
    "* **Configure** (the icon that looks like a gear): Returns you to the edit screen for the settings of the Genie space, much like the screen you saw during the space's creation.\n",
    "  Within Configure you'll have:\n",
    "  * **Data** (the icon that looks like a stacked blocks): Allows you to review and edit the data tables associated with the Space.\n",
    "  * **Instructions** (the icon that looks like a book): Allows you to provide general instructions, in natural language, on how Genie will behave when asked a question by a user.\n",
    "  * **SQL Queries** (the icon will look like a command prompt): Allows you to add example SQL queries for Genie to learn from specific to the associated dataset(s).\n",
    "* **Monitoring** (the icon that looks like a eye): Allows you to review what questions were asked, who asked them, and how they were rated by the user. \n",
    "* **Share** (the icon that looks like a lock): Allows you to set the share permissions and share the Genie space with end users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the kebab menu, you'll find:\n",
    "* **Benchmarks** (the icon that looks like a graduate's mortarboard): Allows you to define a suite of questions that you run on a recurring basis to ensure the space continues to give good answers to the most important user questions.\n",

    "1. Notice that our sample question about total peak load is in a clickable button in the screen's right panel, and so is a sample question we didn't put in: \"Explain the data set\". Click on the **Explain the data set** button. Let's see how well Genie does in understanding our data with very little coaching.\n",
    "1. How did Genie do? Did it figure out that the data sets are linked? Click on the **`(âœ“)Yes`** icon below its response if it did, and click on **`(x)Fix it`** if it didn't.\n",
    "1. Now let's try the other sample question. Type in ```What was the peak total demand?``` and click the paper-airplane icon to submit it.\n",
    "1. Genie gives us a numerical answer. Do we trust it? Ask ```Plot a timeseries of all demand in January``` to compel Genie to show all demand.\n",
    "1. Does the max demand in the plot match the peak demand that Genie provided? Try hovering over the chart to confirm. If yes, click **`(âœ“)Yes`**; if not, click **`(x)Fix it`**.\n",
    "1. Let's continue exploring electricity supply and demand. Say ```What fuel type provides the most power?```\n",
    "1. Does Genie know that Bike Power is not a fuel type? Ask ```How much power is generated by fuel type Bike Power?``` Was its answer appropriate? Did it provide `Null`? If not, give it a **`(âœ“)Yes`**, and a **`(x)Fix it`** if not.\n",
    "1. It's time for a more complex question. Say ```Plot the supply generated from wind for all of January```. Did it do well? Again, give feedback. Can you see what happened during the supply shortage?\n",
    "1. Try asking further questions to understand what drove the supply shortage and demand peak in mid-January 2024.\n",
    "1. We can give Genie specific instructions, for example, provide a instruction for ```Plot the supply generated from wind for all of January```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scroll back up and click on **Add as instruction** so as to save this query as an example query. (Recall that you can only do this because you have at least edit rights on the Genie space. Your end users with only view rights can't add instructions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. If Genie gave you a line chart with that response, say \"give me a bar chart of that\" (and if it gave you a bar chart, ask instead for a line chart).\n",
    "1. Finally, let's ask Genie a question that has nothing to do with our company's data. Compose your own: try a trivia question about your favorite sports team, TV show, or musician. How does Genie respond?\n"
