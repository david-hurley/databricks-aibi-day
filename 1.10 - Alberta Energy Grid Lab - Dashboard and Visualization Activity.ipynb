    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will create a dashboard and make it useful by adding text, data, and interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses the following resources:\n",
    "- Tables:\n",
    "  - Catalog: dbacademy\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "These tables contain real data representing electricity supply and demand and air temperature for the month of January 2024 in Alberta. Between January 11-14 2024, Alberta experienced a perfect storm of low renewable generation (i.e. wind and solar), extreme cold temperatures, and gas plant outages. This led the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) to issue a \"state of emergency\" and that rolling outages would be required if demand was not decreased in order to keep critical infrastructure online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "The **aeso_january_2024_demand** and **aeso_january_2024_supply** tables contain hourly electricity demand and supply data, respectively, in MWs. The **calgary_january_2024_temperature** contains hourly air temperatures, in Celsius, as measured at the Calgary International Airport. These three tables are related via datetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the data in these tables to prepare your dashboard and explore the data to understand more about the electricity shortage that occured in mid-January 2024. \n"

    "1. Copy the SQL query that Assistant suggests and paste it into the SQL editor panel in the center of the screen (over the words \"Start typing...\").\n",
    "1. Run your query and see if it works! You may need to adjust it. If there is an error, Assistant will display a \"Diagnose error\" button to inspect your SQL and offer a corrected query. Copy the new query back into the SQL editor panel, overwriting the previous attempt, and try to run it again. You might need to use the \"Diagnose error\" button more than once.\n",
